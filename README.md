## Capstone Project @Strive
# Reinforcement Learning with Curiosity

I worked on this project to learn Reinforcement Learning. I created a 'Catch the Flag' game with random generated obstacles, and trained an A2C algorithm with an ICM (Intrinsic Curiosity Model).

The AI agent is able to exlpore the gamefield, to find and catch the flag, and get it back to the base.
